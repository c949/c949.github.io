This is my first personal blog and I want to keep it simple and clean.
What about me?
I'm a full stack/Java developer based at Pudong, Shanghai, China. I want to write my feeling about programming somewhere and practise my English. I just search and found a little blog engine so I set up this blog within half day. To be honest, I want to write something because in my daily work I find that software shouldn't be built in a CHAOS way. Building a software should be:
1. Clean
2. Automatical
3. Predictable
4. Standard
...
To long to be short:
There should be only one best way to do things.
If there are two best ways, then just choose the first one.
